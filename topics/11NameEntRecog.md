# Regular Expressions

The problem of named-entity recognition is an NLP task that deals with identifying the entities such as person names, organizations, locations, among others. For example, in "Juan bought a MacBook," the idea is to identify that Juan  is a person, and MacBook is a laptop. This problem has been tackled using different techniques, and the approach followed consists of two steps. The first one is identifying the entity, and the second one corresponds to identifying the types, that is, to know whether the entity is a person name, organization, location, among other types.  

A simple heuristic used to identify entities is to mark as an entity each word starting with a capital letter or an abbreviation. The objective is to design a regular expression that captures these patterns and counts the number of entities found in a given text. The following code shows the structure of the function that needs to be implemented and some examples.

The text normalization techniques used depend on the application; for example, when analyzing social media (e.g., Twitter), there are occasions that it is desired to remove all the mentions of the users in order to keep their privacy; nonetheless, it could be helpful to 2indicate that a username was present. The following exercise consists in creating a function that receives a text and replaces all the appearances of a username with the tag @user.

An essential component when developing an algorithm is to measure its performance. The performance has different forms depending on the algorithm; for example, the performance could be the algorithms' complexity in a sorting algorithm. On the other hand, the performance on machine learning corresponds to measure the similarity between a correct answer and the produce by the algorithm, or equivalent can be an error function. 

This exercise asks to create a function that computes the performance of a sentence tokenizer. The performance measure used is accuracy which is defined as the percentage of correct answers. Let $$y$$ and $$\hat y$$ be the list of correct sentences and the sentences obtained with the tokenizer. Let $$\delta (x)$$ be a function that returns 1 when $$x$$ is true and 0 otherwise. Using these elements the accuracy can be computed as: 

$$\frac{1}{\mid y \mid} \sum_{x \in y} \mathbb 1(x \in \hat y),$$

where the operation $$x \in \hat y$$ deletes the sentence $$x$$ from $$\hat y$$ once it has been tested; this is not normal behavior but it is necessary to compute the accuracy in this situation.
